// session), and `/customers` + `/products` are the ONLY two endpoints the
// public API has — ~42 other paths were probed and every one 404s, so there is
// no per-transaction feed to fall back on. What `/customers` carries is each
// customer's LIFETIME total_spent, their total_transactions, and the date of
// their LATEST transaction.
//
// That shape supports an exact month figure for one-time buyers and nothing
// better than a bound for repeat buyers. This used to add each customer's whole
// lifetime spend into the month of their last transaction, on the assumption
// that one-time purchases dominate the account. That assumption fails as soon as
// a single recurring plan exists: a repeat buyer's payment then lands the whole
// lifetime total in one month and doubles the figure the board shows. Months
// read as exact only when every buyer in them happened to be single-transaction,
// which is luck, not a guarantee.
//
// So we no longer guess. A month reports the EXACT floor it can prove, plus an
// upper bound and a count of the customers whose split is unavailable. Callers
// render the band rather than a confident wrong number.
